To do

- file I/O procedures
- more types
- better checking
- better obarray/no symbol length limit
- no reader string limit
- target most (all?) of R4/R5
- control

Possibly:

- rewrite, either incrementally or entirely, in C for
  readability/maintability
- graphics
- dynamic linking?
- more platforms (POSIX on MIPS, other consoles)
