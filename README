Scheme for MIPS/PSP
-------------------

(Name suggestions welcome)

Not nearly yet R4RS/R5RS compliant

Ported from my RISC-V assembly Scheme interpreter to MIPS assembly:
https://github.com/jeandrek/scratch-risc-v-programs
-- it was really cool how easy it was to get it to start assembling, and
from there not long till it started working.

Depends on pspsdk

Input is pretty bad (left/right triggers to select character; X to input;
square to delete; triangle to enter)

More to come
