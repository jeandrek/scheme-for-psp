    Scheme for MIPS/PSP
    -------------------

(Name suggestions welcome)

Not nearly yet R4RS/R5RS compliant

Ported from my RISC-V assembly Scheme interpreter to MIPS assembly:
https://github.com/jeandrek/scratch-risc-v-programs
-- it was really cool how easy it was to get it to start assembling, and
from there not long till it started working.

Depends on pspsdk

More to come



    RUNNING ON YOUR PSP

Place boot.scm in the root directory of your memory stick.

By default, the read-eval-print-loop will run.  Input is not great
(left/right triggers to select character; X to input; square to delete;
triangle to enter)

If you'd like to try a demo program (at present, there is only one, a
game: demo/game.scm), place it on the memory stick e.g. in the root
directory and add to the end of boot.scm:

    (load "ms0:/game.scm")
